# Fullstack Developer Code Sample Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to give us an example of your work within bounds, guildelines and specifications suppled to you. It provides us some insight into how you work, how you think, and how you build things. It also provides the opportunity for multiple discussion points during an interview. Hopefully this is also fun!

### The Ask

We would like you to build a Rails app that serves a public api and a React app that consumes this api. The Rails app consists of two endpoints:

* A pageable api that allows for searching
* An api that accepts an id, and provides details on a specific object

The React app should match as closely as possible the design found in this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/au6L5XqQ0VjanC9dlgdlmI/Dev-Homework?node-id=2532-2&m=dev&t=xoqFPCWRT0d9yNZp-1). If you want access to pixel perfect measurements, you'll need to log into Figma with an account you create or already have.

### Requirements

* You can build this with any version of Rails and Ruby you see fit
* You can build this with any gems or services you see fit
* We ask that you use SQLite as your database to keep things simple
* We recommend using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to build the frontend portion, but you can use whatever React tool you'd prefer
* There should be reasonable test coverage on both the frontend and backend
* You must use the data/assets provided in the Resources section

### Specifications

The search endpoint should be defined as follows:

`GET /api/search?index=<number>&limit=<number>&query=<string>`

Parameters:

**index**: A numerical index that represents the offset to start returning results from. Default 0.

**limit**: A numerical limit on results to return. Default 10.

**query**: A string to query for results. This should search the **name** of a cocktail recipe inclusively, as in, 'rita' should find 'Margarita'. An empty query string should return an array of unfiltered results.

The result format should look like this:

```
{
  "drinks":
    [
      {
        "id": 1234,
        "name": "Aztec Punch",
        "category": "Punch Party Drink",
        "image": "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/uqwuyp1454514591.jpg"
      },
      ...
   ],
   "totalCount": 1234
}
```

The details endpoint should be defined as follows:
`GET /api/detail?id=<some type of id>`

Parameters:

**id**: This should be an identifier of a cocktail recipe record. I'd assume an int, but if you want to use a UUID string, that's fine too.

The result format should look like this:

```
{
  "drinks":
    [
      {
        "id": 1234,
        "name": "Aztec Punch",
        "category": "Punch Party Drink",
        "container": "Punch bowl",
        "instructions": "Mix all ingredients in a pitcher. Mix thoroughly and pour into whatever is available, the bigger the better! This drink packs a big punch, so don't over do it.",
        "image": "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/uqwuyp1454514591.jpg",
        "ingredients" : [
          {
            "name" : "Lemonade",
            "measurement": "1 can"
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
   ]
}
```

### Resources

This project provides two data files for your use to populate your database, [cocktail_recipes.csv](cocktail_recipes.csv) and [cocktail_recipes.json](cocktail_recipes.json). They both contain the same data, but one is a flat structure suited for csv ingestion, and the other is a hierarchal json file if you prefer to work with that format.

This data is based on the free api at [The Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com), because why can't work be fun? :)

Additionally, a background image and icons are provided in the assets folder for your use in building out the various frontend components.

### Submission

We're flexible in how you submit your work. If you want to .zip it up and email it, that's fine, if you want to create a private github account and submit a link to a repo, that's fine too.

### Thoughts and Notes

This is just an exercise. While the methods and approaches you take to problems should be indicative of how you would approach a problem in a production environment, we don't expect any over-the-top work here. Don't spend tons of time on it. If you think something really needs a complex solution that would take a lot of work, implement a lesser solution, write a note in comments about a proper solution, and we can discuss it.
